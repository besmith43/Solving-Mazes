## Maze Solver

This program is a simple ruby program that I've built based on Computerphile's Maze Solving Python program.  It is relatively simple, and while I fully intent to continue building more functionality into this program.  The base shell of it is already inplace.

This program is "multithreaded" as best as I can, however Ruby does not scale across multiple cores because of the GIL and I have not be so inclined to try my hand at forking processes yet.

In the future, you can expect more aglorithms to solve the mazes, hopefully more mazes in which to solve, and perhaps an NCurses interface.  I have no desire to create a GUI for this program but feel free to fork this and do so if you like.
